# ISBI challenges
Playful attempts at ISBI challenge problems past and present

I will be reproducing past winners (and runners up!) and having a crack at any future challenges.

I wills start with reproducing the [classic Unet model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597v1.pdf) that was applied to [ISBI 2012](http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/home)

Challenge I want to attempt next: https://segpc-2021.grand-challenge.org/SegPC-2021/
